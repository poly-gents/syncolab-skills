# Gym Sales Daily Prioritization

## Purpose

Produce a **ranked daily work list** for gym sales staff from live Arbox tasks and leads, grouped by status category.

## When to Use

- Morning standup or “what should I call first?”
- End-of-day pipeline review.
- After a marketing push when lead volume spikes.

## When NOT to Use

- Manual lead creation (use **gym-lead-ingestion-exceptions**).
- Trial booking or measurements (use **gym-member-onboarding-flow**).

## Expected Outcome

- Numbered call list with name, status, last touch, suggested action, and optional draft opener.
- Follow-up tasks created in Arbox when the rep confirms.

## Workflow

1. Load status semantics via **gym-arbox-status-playbook** (`GET /v3/statuses`).
2. **`arbox_public_get`** → **`v3/tasks`** — open tasks due today or overdue.
3. **`arbox_public_get`** → **`v3/leads`** or **`leadsInProcessReport`** — active pipeline.
4. Group by status category using the tenant status table.
5. Apply default priority (adjust with owner if studio differs):

   1. Closing meetings today / overdue callbacks
   2. Fresh leads (<48h) and scheduled callbacks
   3. Due measurements before nutrition handoff
   4. Existing member touches only when on today's task list
   5. Catch-all / “other” only when explicitly assigned

6. Output numbered list; draft one-line opener in the owner's preferred language.
7. Create follow-up tasks via Arbox task APIs when confirmed.
