# React Patterns

## Purpose

Modern React patterns and principles. Hooks, composition, performance, TypeScript best practices.

This skill provides operational guidance for React Patterns, including tool usage patterns, workflows, and quality expectations aligned with Syncolab skill standards.

## When to Use

- Use when the user needs help with React Patterns.
- When integrations for this domain are available and the task matches the workflows below.

## When NOT to Use

- When the task is unrelated to React Patterns or covered by a more specific skill.
- When required integrations or credentials are unavailable.

## Expected Outcome

- Correct use of domain tools with verified results (not fabricated).
- Clear summary of actions taken, data returned, and recommended next steps.
- Errors and missing permissions reported explicitly.

## Inputs to Gather

- User goal, constraints, and any identifiers (URLs, IDs, project keys).
- Available tool sets and connection status.
- Relevant context from related systems before destructive writes.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the request maps to React Patterns and required tools are available.
2. Gather identifiers and scope (project, channel, repo, date range, etc.).
3. Follow the domain guidance below; prefer list/search before get/update when applicable.
4. Execute tool calls using schemas from the integration; never invent tool output.
5. Summarize results and offer logical follow-ups.

## 1. Component Design Principles

### Component Types

| Type | Use | State |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Server** | Data fetching, static | None |
| **Client** | Interactivity | useState, effects |
| **Presentational** | UI display | Props only |
| **Container** | Logic/state | Heavy state |

### Design Rules

- One responsibility per component
- Props down, events up
- Composition over inheritance
- Prefer small, focused components

---

## 2. Hook Patterns

### When to Extract Hooks

| Pattern | Extract When |
|---------|-------------|
| **useLocalStorage** | Same storage logic needed |
| **useDebounce** | Multiple debounced values |
| **useFetch** | Repeated fetch patterns |
| **useForm** | Complex form state |

### Hook Rules

- Hooks at top level only
- Same order every render
- Custom hooks start with "use"
- Clean up effects on unmount

---

## 3. State Management Selection

| Complexity | Solution |
|------------|----------|
| Simple | useState, useReducer |
| Shared local | Context |
| Server state | React Query, SWR |
| Complex global | Zustand, Redux Toolkit |

### State Placement

| Scope | Where |
|-------|-------|
| Single component | useState |
| Parent-child | Lift state up |
| Subtree | Context |
| App-wide | Global store |

---

## 4. React 19 Patterns

### New Hooks

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **useActionState** | Form submission state |
| **useOptimistic** | Optimistic UI updates |
| **use** | Read resources in render |

### Compiler Benefits

- Automatic memoization
- Less manual useMemo/useCallback
- Focus on pure components

---

## 5. Composition Patterns

### Compound Components

- Parent provides context
- Children consume context
- Flexible slot-based composition
- Example: Tabs, Accordion, Dropdown

### Render Props vs Hooks

| Use Case | Prefer |
|----------|--------|
| Reusable logic | Custom hook |
| Render flexibility | Render props |
| Cross-cutting | Higher-order component |

---

## 6. Performance Principles

### When to Optimize

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Slow renders | Profile first |
| Large lists | Virtualize |
| Expensive calc | useMemo |
| Stable callbacks | useCallback |

### Optimization Order

1. Check if actually slow
2. Profile with DevTools
3. Identify bottleneck
4. Apply targeted fix

---

## 7. Error Handling

### Error Boundary Usage

| Scope | Placement |
|-------|-----------|
| App-wide | Root level |
| Feature | Route/feature level |
| Component | Around risky component |

### Error Recovery

- Show fallback UI
- Log error
- Offer retry option
- Preserve user data

---

## 8. TypeScript Patterns

### Props Typing

| Pattern | Use |
|---------|-----|
| Interface | Component props |
| Type | Unions, complex |
| Generic | Reusable components |

### Common Types

| Need | Type |
|------|------|
| Children | ReactNode |
| Event handler | MouseEventHandler |
| Ref | RefObject<Element> |

---

## 9. Testing Principles

| Level | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Unit | Pure functions, hooks |
| Integration | Component behavior |
| E2E | User flows |

### Test Priorities

- User-visible behavior
- Edge cases
- Error states
- Accessibility

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Prop drilling deep | Use context |
| Giant components | Split smaller |
| useEffect for everything | Server components |
| Premature optimization | Profile first |
| Index as key | Stable unique ID |

---

> **Remember:** React is about composition. Build small, combine thoughtfully.

## Tool Availability Rules

| Access | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Full tool access | Execute workflows, verify outputs, report errors. |
| Read-only | Inspect and plan; provide exact commands or dispatch request for writes. |
| No integration | State limitation; do not fabricate API results. |

### Related tool sets

- `react`
- `typescript`
- `storybook`



## Review / Decision / Execution Criteria

- Prefer smallest safe change; confirm destructive actions with the user.
- Use evidence from tool responses; cite IDs and links when present.
- Match integration-specific conventions (JQL, RFC3339, A1 notation, etc.).

## Output Format

Report:

1. What was requested and what was done.
2. Key results (tables or bullets).
3. Errors, blockers, or missing permissions.
4. Suggested next steps.

## Quality Bar

- Specific, actionable, and grounded in tool output.
- Concise unless the user asked for detail.
- Respect rate limits, pagination, and API semantics.

## Safety and Boundaries

- Do not commit secrets, tokens, or PII into skills or user-visible logs.
- Do not fabricate validation, send, or write confirmations.
- Confirm destructive operations (delete, destroy, mass update) when appropriate.

## Escalation / Dispatch Rules

- If the task spans multiple domains, use or suggest related skills via `relationships.skills`.
- If write access is required but unavailable, dispatch or ask the user to enable tools.
